# Duck Reader for Reddit

An Instagram-style PWA app built with Angular and ngrx. See it in action at: https://tariknz.github.io/reddit-pwa/

## Why

Reddit UX and most Reddit apps are is not media focused, so this is an alternative to let you view reddit like a media feed while also reading the top few comments without opening the comments.

## Status

Pre-alpha, still missing a lot of features. Currently it only displays the front-page

## Development

Built using Angular CLI

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
